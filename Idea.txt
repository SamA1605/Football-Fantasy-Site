Make a game in Unreal Engine using C#

Needs to involve-
	User login/profile system	
	Storing user/game data in a databas
	Allowing users to see who else is online/logged in
	Integration to the Twitter API
	Splitting your app between a client/server to separate the front-end and back-end logic
	persistent 'user' data such as a scoreboard or game stats
	A reporting feature which is able to display those stats
	'Chat' or messaging functionality between users


The quality of the requirements you write can pretty much make or break your project - vague, wooly and ambiguous requirements are a guaranteed path to failure:
	Make sure you draw up detailed UI "mock ups" that someone can look at to understand the context of the app and get a clear idea of how it should look.
	Define 'personas' for different types of users which describe their expectations of the app you're writing (e.g. 'player' might be a persona)
	Write User stories which describe at a high level how the user expects to interact with the app
	Make sure your functional requirements include preconditions and expected outcomes (e.g. a precondition for shooting a gun might be that the gun has ammo, and the expected outcome might be that the gun shoots a bullet)
	Define clear acceptance criteria which can be used to determine whether a functional requirement has been implemented properly
	For each requirement, define functional tests which address every single one of your acceptance criteria by detailing the test steps, the inputs and the expected outcome.
